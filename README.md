# 🚗 Redux Toolkit Car List Project

## Overview

This project is a small demonstration of using Redux Toolkit to manage the state for a car list site. The application allows users to perform the following operations:

- 🚗 Add a car with its cost.
- 📋 Display the car list.
- 🗑️ Delete a car.
- 🔍 Search within the car list.
- 💵 Show the total cost of all cars.

This project follows best practices, incorporates comments, and maintains a clean file structure.
